# Questions

**Describe the data you selected for your analysis. Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the data?**

Search and seizure, vehicles and Miranda warnings are the two data groups that I choose to do this topic is because I believe that search and seizures go hand in hand with miranda warnings. Search and seizures is the act that police do when they have reasonable suspicion and want to search your property. Another reason that I chose this topic is because  I have been in a car that was searched without the officer having any reasonable suspicion. 

**Explain the questions/ arguments your network generates about your data?**

All the networks come up with very similar diagrams that show issues, years of cases, number of votes, the issues, centrality within the cases and a cluster. 

**Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas in our readings, discuss the possibilitie and limits of network analysisas applied to your network and for network analysis generally. Make sure to cite the readers?**

In the reading by M. E. J. Newman, Newman brings up the topic of why are we interested in networks and he states that in a broad term it beings thing together. Networks shows patterns and although we know correlation doesn't mean causation there is a lot that we can learn by looking at the data. Patterns that are in a system are represented as a network the network of stop and seizers and Miranda rights do not correlate as much as i though they would however it is always good to look at to take away preconceived notions
